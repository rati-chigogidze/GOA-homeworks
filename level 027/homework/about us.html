    <p>tens of thousands of volunteers, donors and supporters advance the Make-A-WishÂ® vision to grant the wish of every child diagnosed with a critical illness. In the U.S. and its territories, a wish is granted every 33 minutes. A wish can be that spark that helps these children believe that anything is possible and gives them the strength to fight harder against their illnesses. This one belief guides us and inspires us to grant wishes that change the lives of the kids we serve. 

<h2>Our History</h2>
For children diagnosed with critical illnesses, a wish come true can be a crucial turning point in their lives. A wish can be that spark that helps these children believe that anything is possible and gives them the strength to fight harder against their illnesses. This impact is why we are driven to make every one of these wishes come true.

<h2>How It All Started: Chris' Wish<h2></h2>
Make-A-Wish traces its inspiration to Christopher James Greicius, an energetic 7-year-old boy battling leukemia who wishes to be a police officer. In 1980, his Phoenix community came together to make his wish come true. Little did Chris know that his wish would create a movement that would transform millions of lives.  

Today, Make-A-Wish has granted hundreds of thousands of life-changing wishes to children battling critical illnesses. Wishes that give families hope through dark times, strength to persevere and experiences that forever change their lives.  

Thank you to his mother, Linda Pauling, the Greicius family and the founders for their tireless dedication to our mission.
